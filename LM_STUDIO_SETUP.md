# LM Studio Integration with OpenClip Pro

## Overview

LM Studio support in OpenClip Pro allows you to run AI video analysis completely locally on your machine using open-source language models. This provides:

- **Privacy**: Your videos never leave your machine
- **Cost Control**: No API costs after initial setup
- **Offline Operation**: Works without internet connection
- **Model Choice**: Use any compatible local model

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install LM Studio

1. Visit [https://lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai)
2. Download LM Studio for your operating system
3. Install and launch the application

### 2. Download a Model

1. In LM Studio, go to the "Models" tab
2. Search for and download a model (recommended models):
   - **Llama 2 7B Chat** - Good balance of performance and quality
   - **Mistral 7B Instruct** - Fast and efficient
   - **Code Llama 7B** - Better for technical content
   - **Llama 2 13B Chat** - Higher quality (requires more RAM)

### 3. Start the Local Server

1. In LM Studio, go to the "Chat" tab
2. Load your downloaded model
3. Click the "Start Server" button
4. Note the server URL (typically `http://localhost:1234`)

### 4. Configure OpenClip Pro

1. Open OpenClip Pro Settings
2. Go to the "API Settings" section
3. Find the "LM Studio Configuration" section
4. Enter your LM Studio server URL (usually `http://localhost:1234`)
5. Click "Test" to verify the connection
6. Select your preferred model from the dropdown

## Usage

### For Video Analysis

1. Create a new project or open existing project
2. Upload your video file
3. Click "Start AI Analysis"
4. Select "LM Studio (Local)" as your provider
5. Enter your analysis prompt
6. Click "Analyze" to start local processing

### Recommended Models by Use Case

| Use Case | Recommended Model | RAM Required | Notes |
|----------|------------------|--------------|-------|
| General Analysis | Llama 2 7B Chat | 8GB+ | Good all-around performance |
| Fast Processing | Mistral 7B Instruct | 6GB+ | Faster responses |
| Technical Content | Code Llama 7B | 8GB+ | Better for tech/code videos |
| High Quality | Llama 2 13B Chat | 16GB+ | Best quality, slower |
| Conversation/Podcast | Llama 2 7B Chat | 8GB+ | Good for dialogue analysis |

## Performance Tips

### Hardware Optimization

- **RAM**: More RAM allows larger models and faster processing
- **CPU**: Multi-core processors improve inference speed
- **GPU**: Some models support GPU acceleration (check LM Studio settings)

### Model Selection

- **7B models**: Good balance for most users (8GB+ RAM)
- **13B models**: Higher quality but require more resources (16GB+ RAM)
- **Quantized models**: Smaller file sizes with minimal quality loss

### Prompt Engineering for Local Models

Local models work best with clear, specific prompts:

```
Good prompt:
"Analyze this video and identify 3-5 interesting segments for social media clips. Focus on engaging moments, key topics, and natural break points. Provide start/end times and reasons for each segment."

Less effective:
"Find clips"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: "LM Studio connection failed"
**Solutions**:
- Ensure LM Studio is running
- Verify the server is started in LM Studio
- Check the server URL (default: `http://localhost:1234`)
- Make sure no firewall is blocking the connection

**Problem**: "No models loaded in LM Studio"
**Solutions**:
- Download a model in LM Studio first
- Load the model in the Chat tab
- Start the server after loading the model

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow analysis or timeouts
**Solutions**:
- Use a smaller model (7B instead of 13B)
- Close other applications to free up RAM
- Check CPU usage during analysis
- Consider using quantized models

**Problem**: Out of memory errors
**Solutions**:
- Use a smaller model
- Close other applications
- Increase system virtual memory
- Consider upgrading RAM

### Quality Issues

**Problem**: Poor analysis results
**Solutions**:
- Try a different model (Llama 2 often works well)
- Improve your prompt (be more specific)
- Ensure the model is fully loaded
- Consider using a larger model if resources allow

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Server Settings

You can run LM Studio on different ports or even remote machines:

```
# Different port
http://localhost:8080

# Remote machine (if accessible)
http://192.168.1.100:1234
```

### Integration with Other Tools

LM Studio can work alongside cloud providers:
- Use LM Studio for privacy-sensitive content
- Use cloud providers for high-volume processing
- Switch between providers based on content type

## Security and Privacy

### Data Handling

- **Local Processing**: Videos and analysis stay on your machine
- **No Internet Required**: After model download, works offline
- **No Logging**: LM Studio doesn't log your queries by default

### Network Security

- LM Studio server runs locally by default
- Only accessible from your machine unless configured otherwise
- No data sent to external servers during analysis
